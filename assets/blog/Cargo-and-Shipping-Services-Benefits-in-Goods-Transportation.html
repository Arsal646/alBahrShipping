                        <h2>What are Cargo Services?</h2>
                        <p>Cargo is also called freight. It is all about transporting goods from one place to another by
                            either land, water, or air. The word "cargo" originally referred to items being loaded into
                            a ship. However, in modern times, all forms of commodities, whether they be transported by
                            truck, van, train, or intermodal container, are referred to as cargo.
                            <br><br>
                            Although "cargo" refers to all items in a transport vehicle, it does not include things like
                            security personnel bags, goods in storage, equipment, or supplies taken on board to support
                            the transport. The primary purpose of transporting cargo is commercial, for which the
                            carrier issues an air waybill, bill of lading, or other receipts.
                            <br><br>
                            Cargo services are a type of shipping service that helps businesses move their products and
                            materials from one location to another. These services can be used to ship items
                            domestically or internationally, and they can be provided by a variety of different
                            companies. Cargo services can provide many benefits to businesses, including the ability to
                            save time and money on shipping costs. In addition, cargo services can provide businesses
                            with peace of mind knowing that their products will arrive safely and on time.
